Let me break down how the `sendMailboxStatusBinary()` function works step by step:

---

### **Purpose of the Function**
The goal of this function is to encode the `mailDetected` status of up to 16 mailboxes into a **16-bit integer** (`uint16_t`) and send it over `Serial2` as two bytes. Each bit in the 16-bit integer represents the `mailDetected` status of a specific mailbox:
- `1` means mail is detected.
- `0` means no mail is detected.

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

#### **1. Declare a 16-bit Integer (`uint16_t`)**
```cpp
uint16_t status = 0;
```
- `uint16_t` is an **unsigned 16-bit integer**, meaning it can store values from `0` to `65535` (16 bits = 2 bytes).
- Initially, `status` is set to `0`, meaning all bits are `0` (no mail detected for any mailbox).

---

#### **2. Iterate Through All Compartments**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < totalCompartments; i++) {
    if (compartments[i].mailDetected) {
        status |= (1 << i); // Set the bit corresponding to the mailbox
    }
}
```
- This loop goes through all compartments in the `compartments` array.
- For each compartment:
  - If `mailDetected` is `true`, the corresponding bit in the `status` variable is set to `1`.
  - If `mailDetected` is `false`, the bit remains `0`.

---

#### **3. How `status |= (1 << i)` Works**
This line is the key to encoding the `mailDetected` status into the `status` variable.

1. **`1 << i`**:
   - This shifts the binary value `1` to the left by `i` positions.
   - For example:
     - If `i = 0`: `1 << 0` = `0000000000000001` (bit 0 is set).
     - If `i = 1`: `1 << 1` = `0000000000000010` (bit 1 is set).
     - If `i = 2`: `1 << 2` = `0000000000000100` (bit 2 is set).

2. **`status |= (1 << i)`**:
   - The `|=` operator performs a **bitwise OR** between `status` and `(1 << i)`.
   - This sets the `i`-th bit of `status` to `1` without affecting the other bits.
   - For example:
     - If `status = 0000000000000000` and `i = 2`:
       - `(1 << 2)` = `0000000000000100`
       - `status |= (1 << 2)` = `0000000000000100`
     - If `status = 0000000000000100` and `i = 3`:
       - `(1 << 3)` = `0000000000001000`
       - `status |= (1 << 3)` = `0000000000001100`

---

#### **4. Send the 16-Bit Status as Two Bytes**
```cpp
Serial2.write((status >> 8) & 0xFF); // Send the high byte
Serial2.write(status & 0xFF);        // Send the low byte
```
- The `status` variable is a 16-bit integer, but `Serial2.write()` can only send one byte (8 bits) at a time. So, the 16-bit integer is split into two bytes:
  1. **High Byte**:
     - `(status >> 8)` shifts the 16-bit integer 8 bits to the right, leaving only the high byte.
     - `& 0xFF` ensures that only the lower 8 bits of the result are kept.
     - For example:
       - If `status = 1010101010101010`:
         - `(status >> 8)` = `0000000010101010`
         - `(status >> 8) & 0xFF` = `10101010` (high byte).
  2. **Low Byte**:
     - `status & 0xFF` extracts the lower 8 bits of the 16-bit integer.
     - For example:
       - If `status = 1010101010101010`:
         - `status & 0xFF` = `10101010` (low byte).

- These two bytes are sent sequentially over `Serial2`.

### **Example Walkthrough**
Let’s say you have 4 mailboxes, and their `mailDetected` statuses are as follows:
- Mailbox 1: `true`
- Mailbox 2: `false`
- Mailbox 3: `true`
- Mailbox 4: `false`

#### **Step 1: Encode the Status**
- Start with `status = 0` (binary: `0000000000000000`).
- For each mailbox:
  - Mailbox 1 (`i = 0`, `mailDetected = true`):
    - `(1 << 0)` = `0000000000000001`
    - `status |= (1 << 0)` → `status = 0000000000000001`
  - Mailbox 2 (`i = 1`, `mailDetected = false`):
    - No change to `status`.
  - Mailbox 3 (`i = 2`, `mailDetected = true`):
    - `(1 << 2)` = `0000000000000100`
    - `status |= (1 << 2)` → `status = 0000000000000101`
  - Mailbox 4 (`i = 3`, `mailDetected = false`):
    - No change to `status`.

Final `status` = `0000000000000101` (binary) = `5` (decimal).

#### **Step 2: Send the Status**
- High Byte:
  - `(status >> 8)` = `00000000`
  - `(status >> 8) & 0xFF` = `00000000` (high byte = `0`).
- Low Byte:
  - `status & 0xFF` = `00000101` (low byte = `5`).

`Serial2.write()` sends:
- High byte: `0`
- Low byte: `5`

---

### **Receiving Side**
On the receiving side, you can reconstruct the 16-bit status from the two bytes:
```cpp
uint16_t status = (highByte << 8) | lowByte;
```
Then, check each bit to determine the `mailDetected` status for each mailbox:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
    if (status & (1 << i)) {
        // Mail is detected for mailbox i + 1
    } else {
        // No mail for mailbox i + 1
    }
}
```

---

### **Summary**
- The function encodes the `mailDetected` status of up to 16 mailboxes into a 16-bit integer.
- Each bit in the integer represents the status of one mailbox (`1` = mail detected, `0` = no mail).
- The 16-bit integer is split into two bytes and sent over `Serial2`.
- This approach is compact and efficient for transmitting the status of multiple mailboxes.
